                <p>What better sight for a parent than to see their dear child succeed and soar high in life? There is nothing more human or more satisfying than that. But sometimes, things may appear different. Perhaps you’ve suspected it too, that your child is not cut from the same cloth than everyone else. That they are, in other words, a prodigy.</p>
                <p>Have you suspected it too? Here are a few tell-tale signs:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Increased verbosity: Your child imitates the sounds around them and can form sentences of various noises.<br></li>
                  <li>Musical virtuosity: Already, they are experimenting with advanced vocalization techniques, with bravado and enthusiasm!<br></li>
                  <li>Lack of sleep: Does your kid never stop, for just one second? They are trying to process everything, memorizing patterns invisible to most.<br></li>
                  <li>Artistic virtuosity: Those black patterns left on the walls by your child? They’re early signs of an awakening abstract movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Questions start to arise. Will I be able to keep up? Will my child get along with the other kids? Can I still feed him milk? (The answer is yes). No matter the concerns, we are here to make sure that your offspring becomes the greatest, most accomplished version of themselves they can be.
